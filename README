Signing data is a powerful way to deter bad actors from tampering with data. 
It bases itself off of cryptographically secure hash functions using a secret 
key as a salt for the data. 

When the user makes a request, first check to see if the payload matches the 
signature and if not destroy the user’s cookie.

This is a simple web service that has two resources ­­ one to generate a checksummed 
callback URL and the second to take a callback URL and verify the checksum. 

The code is generic to handle any set of parameters on the callback URL and still 
provide a correct checksum.
